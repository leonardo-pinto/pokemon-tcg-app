    text: "A bit part of the Pokémon TCG, like most trading card games, is that mad rush to find the highest-rated and rarest cards. Some of them are even banned because they simply break the game. Others are just quirky and delightful. One of the more unique cards is Happy Birthday Pikachu, which not only has an attractive artwork but also boosts its attacking power if it happens to be the player's birthday. It is indeed the most beneficial present to have while celebrating your birthday.",

    text: 'Old is not gold in Pokémon TCG. Due to the increase in the latest edition of the cards, the older ones have become out of scope. Moreover, just like many other games, the Pokémon TCG has also been upgrading the powers of its monsters, therefore, it becomes a lot more difficult for the users to compete using the older cards.While this does not mean players cannot play with older cards, they are not usually of much use.',

    image: secretCards,
    text: "There are thousands of Pokémon TCG cards available, which naturally makes it difficult to hunt for the rarer ones. So, it can be extremely helpful for players to identify the timeline of a card they have found.To check a card's rarity, simply check the card's bottom corner. If there is a circle, it means it is way too common. If there is a diamond, the card is a little uncommon. A star represents a rare one and, lastly, if there is a white star, the card is ultra-rare. However, there are cards that go beyond a set's (seemingly) rarest cards. While every set mentions that it contains a specific number of cards, secret cards exist that are numbered above that threshold.",

    text: "Occasionally, a super unique card is published for promotional purposes. While not often the strongest of cards, they tend to be worth a lot. Just before the game became huge outside of Japan, a limited batch of Raichu cards was made which differ from the rest of the cards, as each one of them had the word 'prerelease' written on the bottom.Interestingly, only about ten copied were made and almost all of them were able to fetch a huge price at auctions.",

    text: "While a lot is known about Pokémon's mascot, some might be surprised to learn that Pikachu has a hidden talent. Yes, Pikachu has some artistic skills, as proven through the famous Illustrator TCG cards. These cards were rewarded to winning artists who competed in a 1998 illustration contest.A total of 39 cards were originally introduced and these too got amazing attention at auction because of their limited nature and popularity.",
